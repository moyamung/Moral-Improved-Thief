UNICOM disappeared and people started to create a new world.
I'm glad to see my grandpa again.
	
People praise me for being brave,
but I'm a little embarassed of those stories.
	
From now on, I will live doing what I want to do.
	
First of all, I have to go to have a nice dinner with my grandfather.
