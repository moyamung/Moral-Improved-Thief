Now it's 62 AU (After Union).
I don't know what does Union exactly means.
	
When I asked my teacher, she just said it is the day that the world have been integrated, by the great United Network Integrated COMpany, as known as UNICOM.
	
I could asked my family, but I didn't want to do that.
When I talked about this, my grandpa always talks weird things.
	
He always said "When I was your age, I can learn, see, and talk about all of things..."
	
Then one day, my grandpa said, "I miss freedom," and then he left the house.
And the next day, Grandpa was taken to the police with all of his belongings.
	
My mom said we cannot see him anymore.
I can't understand why police arrested him.
	
Suddenly, I remembered the postcard that my grandpa gave me.
Fortunately, It was in my drawer.
	
There was a phrase on it:
<b><i>All you want is in the Living Library</i></b>
	
Now I'm wondering why my grandpa said that.
I'm becoming thief, who fights for society.
